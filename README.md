# Rainfall Prediction Using Python üåßÔ∏è
Overview
Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in agriculture, water resource management, disaster preparedness, and climate studies. This project demonstrates how to predict rainfall using Python by leveraging historical weather data and machine learning techniques.

The project includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw weather data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through visualizations and statistics.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features to improve model accuracy.
Model Training and Evaluation: Building and assessing machine learning models for accurate rainfall prediction.
Project Workflow
This project follows a structured approach:

1. Data Collection
The input data includes historical weather information such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and previous rainfall records.
You can use publicly available datasets, such as those from Kaggle, meteorological organizations, or generate synthetic data for demonstration purposes.
2. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing ensures the dataset is clean and suitable for modeling. Steps include:

Handling missing or erroneous data.
Encoding categorical variables (if any).
Normalizing or standardizing numerical features.
Splitting data into training and testing subsets.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps uncover patterns, correlations, and trends in the data:

Correlation heatmaps identify relationships between features.
Line plots and histograms visualize temporal trends and data distributions.
Boxplots detect outliers in the data.
4. Feature Engineering
Creating meaningful features can significantly enhance model performance:

Lagged rainfall values (e.g., rainfall from the previous day/week/month).
Seasonal indicators (e.g., month or season).
Derived variables like temperature difference or moving averages.
5. Model Building
Machine learning models are used to predict rainfall based on input features. Common algorithms include:

Linear Regression: A simple and interpretable baseline model.
Random Forest: A robust ensemble method for capturing non-linear relationships.
XGBoost: A powerful boosting algorithm for predictive accuracy.
Deep Learning Models: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for temporal sequences.
6. Model Evaluation
The models are assessed using performance metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Highlights larger errors due to squaring.
R¬≤ Score: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data.
